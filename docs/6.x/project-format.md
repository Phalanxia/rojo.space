## Project File
Rojo projects are JSON files that have the `.project.json` extension. They have the following fields:

* `name`: A string indicating the name of the project. This name is used when building the project into a model or place file.
    * **Required**
* `tree`: An [Instance Description](#instance-description) describing the root instance of the project.
    * **Required**
* `servePort`: The port that `rojo serve` should listen on. Passing `--port` will override this setting.
    * **Optional**
    * Default is `34872`
* `servePlaceIds`: A list of place IDs that this project may be live-synced to. This feature can help prevent overwriting the wrong game with source from Rojo.
    * **Optional**
    * Default is `null`
* `globIgnorePaths`: A list of globs of paths to ignore.
    * **Optional**
    * Default is `[]`

## Instance Description
Instance Descriptions correspond one-to-one with the actual Roblox Instances in the project.

* `$className`: The ClassName of the Instance being described.
    * **Optional if `$path` is specified or if the instance is a Roblox service.**
* `$path`: The path on the filesystem to pull files from into the project.
    * **Optional if `$className` is specified.**
    * Paths are relative to the folder containing the project file.
* `$properties`: Properties to apply to the instance. Values should be [Instance Property Values](#instance-property-value).
    * **Optional**
* `$ignoreUnknownInstances`: Whether instances that Rojo doesn't know about should be deleted.
    * **Optional**
    * Default is `false` if `$path` is specified, otherwise `true`.

All other fields in an Instance Description are turned into instances whose name is the key. These values should also be Instance Descriptions!

## Instance Property Value
There are two kinds of property values on instances, **implicit** and **explicit**.

In the vast majority of cases, you should be able to use **implicit** property values. To use them, just use a value that's the same shape as the type that the property has:

```json
"MyPart": {
    "$className": "Part",
    "$properties": {
        "Size": [3, 5, 3],
        "Color": [0.5, 0, 0.5],
        "Anchored": true,
        "Material": "Granite"
    }
}
```

`Vector3` and `Color3` properties can just be arrays of numbers, as can types like `Vector2`, `CFrame`, and more!

Enums can be set to a string containing the enum variant. Rojo will raise an error if the string isn't a valid variant for the enum.

There are some cases where this syntax for assigning properties _doesn't_ work. In these cases, Rojo requires you to use the **explicit** property syntax.

Some reasons why you might need to use an **explicit** property:

* Using exotic property types like `BinaryString`
* Using properties added to Roblox recently that Rojo doesn't know about yet

The shape of explicit property values is defined by the [rbx-dom](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/rbx-dom) library, so it uses slightly different conventions than the rest of Rojo.

Each value should be an object with the following required fields:

* `Type`: The type of property to represent.
    * [Supported types can be found here](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/rbx-tree#property-type-coverage).
* `Value`: The value of the property.
    * The shape of this field depends on which property type is being used. `Vector3` and `Color3` values are both represented as a list of numbers, while `BinaryString` expects a base64-encoded string, for example.

Here's the same object, but with explicit properties:

```json
"MyPart": {
    "$className": "Part",
    "$properties": {
        "Size": {
            "Type": "Vector3",
            "Value": [3, 5, 3]
        },
        "Color": {
            "Type": "Color3",
            "Value": [0.5, 0, 0.5]
        },
        "Anchored": {
            "Type": "Bool",
            "Value": true
        },
        "Material": {
            "Type": "Enum",
            "Value": 832
        }
    }
}
```

## Example Projects
This project bundles up everything in the `src` directory. It'd be suitable for making a plugin or model:

```json
{
    "name": "AwesomeLibrary",
    "tree": {
        "$path": "src"
    }
}
```

This project describes the layout you might use if you were making the next hit simulator game, *Sisyphus Simulator*:

```json
{
    "name": "Sisyphus Simulator",
    "globIgnorePaths": ["**/*.spec.lua", "**/*.spec"],
    "tree": {
        "$className": "DataModel",

        "HttpService": {
            "$className": "HttpService",
            "$properties": {
                "HttpEnabled": true
            }
        },

        "ReplicatedStorage": {
            "$className": "ReplicatedStorage",
            "$path": "src/ReplicatedStorage"
        },

        "StarterPlayer": {
            "$className": "StarterPlayer",

            "StarterPlayerScripts": {
                "$className": "StarterPlayerScripts",
                "$path": "src/StarterPlayerScripts"
            }
        },

        "Workspace": {
            "$className": "Workspace",
            "$properties": {
                "Gravity": 67.3
            },

            "Terrain": {
                "$path": "Terrain.rbxm"
            }
        }
    }
}
```
